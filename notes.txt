- in urls.py, in urlpatterns array we list all the page paths pretty much
- path('', include('api.urls')) means that if the url path == '', we then have access to all the urls in api.urls  
    - if '' were to instead be something like 'home', we can then go to like domain.com/home/main, if main was a path 
    in api.urls
- "python manage.py runserver" to start the app on django side.
    - cd scheduler/ && python manage.py runserver
    - make sure you're cd'd into the right directory 

- start the thing on the react side
    - cd scheduler/frontend && npm run dev 
    - note that this is not a native command, it's a script in package.json

- everytime we modify the database, we have to make migrations, essentially converting python models to actual sql tables 
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

    - python manage.py shell

querying stuff:
from api import models
from api.models import deleteUser 
from api.models import createNewUser 
from api.models import createNewTask
import datetime
models.User.objects.all()
x = datetime.datetime(2020, 5, 17)
createNewTask("kill joey", x, models.User.objects.filter(username="name")[0])
createNewUser('name', 'pwd', 21)
